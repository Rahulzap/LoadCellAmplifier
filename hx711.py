    Typical user config directories are:
        Mac OS X:               same as user_data_dir
        Unix:                   ~/.config/<AppName>     # or in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, if defined
        Win *:                  same as user_data_dir

    For Unix, we follow the XDG spec and support $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
    That means, by default "~/.config/<AppName>".

        "appname" is the name of application.
            If None, just the system directory is returned.
        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the
            appauthor or distributing body for this application. Typically
            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may
            pass False to disable it.
        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the
            path. You might want to use this if you want multiple versions
            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "multipath" is an optional parameter only applicable to *nix
            which indicates that the entire list of config dirs should be
            returned. By default, the first item from XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is
            returned, or '/etc/xdg/<AppName>', if XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is not set

    Typical site config directories are:
        Mac OS X:   same as site_data_dir

                    $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
        Win *:      same as site_data_dir
        Vista:      (Fail! "C:\ProgramData" is a hidden *system* directory on Vista.)

    For Unix, this is using the $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS[0] default, if multipath=False

    WARNING: Do not use this on Windows. See the Vista-Fail note above for why.

        "appname" is the name of application.
            If None, just the system directory is returned.
        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the

        "opinion" (boolean) can be False to disable the appending of
            "Cache" to the base app data dir for Windows. See
            discussion below.

    Typical user cache directories are:
        Mac OS X:   ~/Library/Caches/<AppName>
        Unix:       ~/.cache/<AppName> (XDG default)
        Win XP:     C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Cache
        Vista:      C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Cache

    On Windows the only suggestion in the MSDN docs is that local settings go in
    the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` directory. This is identical to the non-roaming
    app data dir (the default returned by `user_data_dir` above). Apps typically
    put cache data somewhere *under* the given dir here. Some examples:
        ...\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<ProfileName>\Cache
        ...\Acme\SuperApp\Cache\1.0
    OPINION: This function appends "Cache" to the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` value.
    This can be disabled with the `opinion=False` option.
